Sample Data Science in Context Presentations
Posted on: Tuesday, February 16, 2021 1:25:43 PM EST

Here are three examples of Data Science in Context presentations.
The first one is an exemplary presentation from your class mate Joshua Hummell;
the second and third are from previous DATA 607 students.

You can pick pretty much any Data Science-related topic.
The Asset Management talk above would be an invaluable overview for a data scientist
starting his or her first project for a commercial real estate firm. Picking a topic
that you find challenging and explaining it effectively is a great way to deepen your
learning--see the Feynman Technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkm0TNFzIeg. 

Itâ€™s important that you rehearse your presentation so that it can be done in about
five minutes. Creating a video is a superb way to rehearse.
