Overview
========

![](table.png){ width=50% }

The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:

1. Create a **.CSV file** (or **optionally**, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.
      +   You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
2. Read the information from your **.CSV** file into$\ R$, and use `tidyr` and `dplyr` as needed to *tidy*
and transform your data.
3. Perform **analysis to compare** the **arrival delays** for the **two airlines**.
4. Your code should be in an$\ R \ Markdown$ **file**, posted to [RPUBS](rpubs.com), and should include **narrative descriptions** of your **data cleanup work**, **analysis**, and **conclusions**. Please include in your homework submission:
      * The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
      * The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

Import Data
===========

Data is imported from the `.csv` file located in my [github Week 5 folder](https://github.com/gcampos100/DATA607Spring2021/tree/main/Projects/Project%201). Function `read.csv` from the `utils` package is used. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Store Github url to variable
url= 
"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcampos100/DATA607Spring2021/main/Week%205/HW/arrival_delays.csv"
```

```{r}
arrivals_delays <- read.csv(url, as.is = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(arrivals_delays,booktabs = T, caption = "arrivals_delays") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling() %>%
kableExtra::footnote("The present table reflects the NULL cells and unlabeled columns in the .csv file",general_title = "NOTE:" ,title_format = "bold")
```

Cleanup
=======

The above data set has a few problems that need correcting including:

* Removal of row comprised of empty cells (`  `) and `NA`
* Relabeling of column names for functional use
* Inserting logical data, for blank cells in column 1.

### `NA` Removal

The only row requiring removal is row 3. This is done using brackets `[ ]` in conjunction with `-` symbol to specify removal of the selected row.  

```{r}
(arrivals_delays <- arrivals_delays[-3,])
```

### Relabeling of `colnames`

Since all but two columns are labeled correctly, a list of names is best to insert into the data frame.

```{r}
df_names <-
  c("Airline", "Arrival", "Los Angeles", "Phoenix",
    "San Diego", "San Francisco", "Seattle")

colnames(arrivals_delays) <- df_names
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
arrivals_delays
```

### Inserting Data

The most logical data to place inside the empty cells in column one, is the *Airline* being referenced. Rather than manually type in the name I chose to reference the Airline name in the row before the blank one. Had this been a larger data set a *while loop* may have been a helpful tool.

```{r}

arrivals_delays[2,1]<-arrivals_delays[1,1]
arrivals_delays[4,1]<-arrivals_delays[3,1]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(arrivals_delays,booktabs = T, caption = "arrivals_delays",row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic_2()
```

## Transforming columns and rows

### Gather()

Using [gather() function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/gather) along with *pipe* `%>%` I reorganize the data so the counts and cities are accounted for on two columns. 

* `key` is the name of the *new key* or column holding the previous **column names**
* `value`  is the name of the column holding the **values** associated with said **key** values.

```{r, results='hold'}
(arrivals_delays_steps<-arrivals_delays %>%
  gather(key = "City",value = "Count", 3:7))
```

### Spread()

Using [spread() function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyr/versions/0.8.3/topics/spread)  

* `key` is the column name or positions we are referencing.
* `values` are still the values affiliated with the key, but graphically the reference is lateral. Technically the shared relationship for these options is a single row.
* Columns $\ 2 \ \&\ 4$ are referenced.
**e.g.**[^1]

[^1]:`arrivals_delays[2]` and `arrivals_delays[4]` for columns 2 & 4 respectively:

```{r, results='hold'}
(arrivals_delays_steps<-arrivals_delays_steps %>%
  spread(key = 2,value = 4))
```

### Arrange()

Using the [arrange() function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8/topics/arrange) I sort the data by city

```{r}
arrivals_delays_steps %>%
  arrange(City)
```

### Single command

Alternatively all step can occur at once

```{r}
(arrivals_delays<-arrivals_delays %>%
  gather(key = "City",value = "Count", 3:7)%>%
    spread(key = 2,value = 4) %>%
        arrange(City))
```

### Calculations

The Calculations are as follows:

* `Total Flights` = `delayed` + `on time` values by row.
* The for loop traverses each row, calculating `Total Flights` and storing it in the corresponding row.
* `Delay Rate` and `On Time Rate` are calculated by dividing entire columns:
  + `delayed`/`Total Flights`
  + `on time`/`Total Flights`

```{r, include=FALSE}
dim(arrivals_delays)
nrow(arrivals_delays)
arrivals_delays[1,3]
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
#total_flights<-c(10)
#delay_rates<-c(10)
#on_time_rate<-c(10)
arrivals_delays$`on time`
```


```{r, results=FALSE}
# for loop to create totals
for(row in 1:nrow(arrivals_delays))
  arrivals_delays$`Total Flights`[row]<-
  as.numeric(arrivals_delays[row,3])+
  as.numeric(gsub(",","",arrivals_delays[row,4]))

#outside of for loop calculations for rates
  arrivals_delays$`Delay Rate`<-
    round( as.numeric( arrivals_delays$delayed ) / arrivals_delays$`Total Flights`,2 ) 

#arrival rates calculations
  arrivals_delays$`On Time Rate`<-
    round( as.numeric( gsub(",","",arrivals_delays$`on time` )) / arrivals_delays$`Total Flights`,2 ) 

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kableExtra::kbl(arrivals_delays,booktabs = T, caption = "arrivals_delays",row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_minimal()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_no_filter<-arrivals_delays %>%
  select(Airline , City, `Delay Rate`,`On Time Rate`)

plot_AK_del<-arrivals_delays %>%
  select(Airline , City, `Delay Rate`,`On Time Rate`) %>%
    filter(Airline == "ALASKA")

plot_AM_del<-arrivals_delays %>%
  select(Airline , City, `Delay Rate`,`On Time Rate`) %>%
    filter(Airline == "AM WEST")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
arrivals_delays$delayed <-as.numeric(arrivals_delays$delayed)
class(arrivals_delays$delayed)
arrivals_delays$`on time` <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",arrivals_delays$`on time`))
class(arrivals_delays$`on time`)
```

Conclusion
==========

The summary below and the corresponding line graphs show, AM West varies greatly on its delay and on time rate by city, specifically regarding San Francisco. **ALASKA** airlines, however, fluctuates less and is consistently on time more with less delays on all major cities compared to **AM WEST**.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
arrivals_delays %>%
  group_by(Airline) %>%
    summarise("Avg Delay" = mean(delayed),
              "Avg Delay Rate" = mean(`Delay Rate`),
              "On Time Avg" = mean(`on time`),
              "On Time Avg Rate" = mean(`On Time Rate`)
              )
              
```


```{r, results= 'hold', out.width="50%", echo = FALSE}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data = plot_no_filter,aes(x = City , y = `Delay Rate`, colour = Airline, group = 1))+
  geom_line(data=plot_AK_del, aes(x = City , y = `Delay Rate`, group = 2, colour = Airline))+
  geom_line(data=plot_AM_del, aes(x = City , y = `Delay Rate`, group = 2, colour = Airline))

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data = plot_no_filter,aes(x = City , y = `On Time Rate`, colour = Airline, group = 1))+
  geom_line(data=plot_AK_del, aes(x = City , y = `On Time Rate`, group = 2, colour = Airline))+
  geom_line(data=plot_AM_del, aes(x = City , y = `On Time Rate`, group = 2, colour = Airline))
```
