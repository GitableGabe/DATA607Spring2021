Assignment Requirements
=======================
1. Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.com’s College Majors dataset [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"

2. Write code that transforms the data below:

    [1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"

    [5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  

    [9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    

    [13] "olive"        "salal berry"

Into a format like this:

    c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")

**The two exercises below are taken from R for Data Science, 14.3.5.1 in the on-line version:**

3. Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

 ![](Q3.png)
      

4. Construct regular expressions to match words that:

    Start and end with the same character.\newline
    
    Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)\newline
    
    Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)

Question 1
==========

`The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major` article data is stored on the [fivethirtyeight github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors). I will be importing my data from the [majors=list.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/majors-list.csv) and the [grad-students.csv](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/grad-students.csv) respectively.

```{r}
majors_list<-
read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/majors-list.csv",
           header= TRUE, sep=",")

majors_list<-majors_list[order(majors_list$Major),]

grad_students<-
read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/grad-students.csv", 
           header= TRUE, sep=",")

grad_students<-grad_students[order(grad_students$Major),]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
paste0("Columns for major_lists are:")
names(majors_list)
paste0("Columns for grad_students are:")
names(grad_students)
```

## ANSWER

**The majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS" in them, are as follows, according to both datasets:**

```{r}
dplyr::filter(majors_list, grepl('data|Data|DATA|statistic|Statistic|STATISTIC', Major))

dplyr::filter(majors_list, grepl('data|Data|DATA|statistic|Statistic|STATISTIC', Major))
```

Question 2
===========

Write code that transforms the data below: \newline

**NOTE: the data below is in a matrix with the number values in brackets representing the row name.**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Matrix creation
x_matrix<-rbind(c("bell pepper","bilberry","blackberry","blood orange"),
      c("blueberry","cantaloupe","chili pepper","cloudberry"),
      c("elderberry","lime","lychee","mulberry"),
      c("olive","salal berry",'',""))
# Matching rownames
row.names(x_matrix)<-c("[1]","[5]","[9]","[13]")

x_matrix
```

Into a format like this:
    c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")
    
## ANSWER

```{r}
quotes = '"'
quotes
```

```{r}
# Make vector
x_vector<-as.vector(t(x_matrix[c("[1]","[5]","[9]","[13]"),]))
# Remove "" based on index search
x_vector<- x_vector[-(match("",x_vector))]
x_vector<- x_vector[-(match("",x_vector))]
# add quotes on each element
x_vector <-paste(quotes,x_vector,quotes, sep = "")
# add commas at the end of all elements but the last one
x_vector <- paste(c("","","","","","","","","","","","","",""), x_vector, sep = "")
# collapse to a single string
x_vector <- paste(x_vector, collapse = ", ")
# add 'C()' wrapper
x_vector <- paste("c(",x_vector, ")", sep = "")
cat(x_vector)
```


Question 3
==========

    (.)\1\1                   |`( )` group
                              |`(.)` match-any-character operator matches any character except line
                              |      terminator
                              |`\1`  back-reference-operator references capturing group `\1`
                              |`\1`  the second is just to replace duplicate words of group `\1`
                              |NOTE: Regex requires `\` escapes with `R` functions since parameter is inserted
                              |       as a string. This combiniation finds triples.
                              |
    "(.)(.)\\2\\1"            |`( )` group
                              |`(.)` match-any-character operator group 1
                              |`(.)` match-any-character operator group 2
                              |`\\2` back-reference-operator with `\` to escape references capturing group `\2`
                              |`\\1` back-reference-operator with `\` to escape references capturing group `\1`
                              |NOTE: Regex matches 2 groups of doubles such as `bbbb` or `abba`
                              |
    (..)\1                    |`(..)` same as match-any-character group 1
                              |`\1`  back-references group `\1`
                              |NOTE: Requires `\` escape. Regex finds 1 group of quadruples
                              |
    "(.).\\1.\\1"             |. Works as wild cards outside of `( )`. Regex searches for a repeated character
                              |3 times and seperated by any character
                              |
    "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"    |`(.)(.)(.)` 3 grouping
                              |. wild card for string beginning with group
                              |* 0 to ∞ combinations with these specific regex
                              |`\\3\\2\\1` back-reference 3 seperate groups
                              |This expression finds 3 seperate groups of matching characters



```{r, echo=FALSE}
example<-c("abcd","1234","!@#$*(&^","eeffggeeeffggg","5678","2","banana","abaca","aabbbbaaa","abba")
```

## ANSWER

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='show'}
# Regex example (.)\1\1
str_view(example,"(.)\\1\\1",match = T)

# Regex example "(.)(.)\\2\\1"
str_view(example,"(.)(.)\\2\\1",match = T)

# Regex example (..)\1
str_view(example,"(..)\\1",match = T)

# Regex example  "(.).\\1.\\1" 
str_view(example,"(.).\\1.\\1",match = T)

# Regex example  "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"
str_view(example,"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1",match = T)
```

Question 4
==========

## ANSWER

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='show'}
# Start and end with the same character.
str_view(example,"^(.).*\\1$",match = T)
# Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)
str_view(example, "(..).*\\1",match = T)
#Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)
str_view(example,"(.).*\\1.*\\1",match = T)
